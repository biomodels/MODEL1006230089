**Abstract:**   
The guinea-pig ventricular cell model, originally developed by Noble et al in
1991, has been greatly extended to include accumulation and depletion of
calcium in a diadic space between the sarcolemma and the sarcoplasmic
reticulum where, according to contempory understanding, the majority of
calcium-induced calcium release is triggered. The calcium in this space is
also assumed to play the major role in calcium-induced inactivation of the
calcium current. Delayed potassium current equations have been developed to
include the rapid (IKr) and slow (IKs) components of the delayed rectifier
current based on the data of of Heath and Terrar, along with data from
Sanguinetti and Jurkiewicz. Length- and tension-dependent changes in
mechanical and electrophysiological processes have been incorporated as
described recently by Kohl et al. Drug receptor interactions have started to
be developed, using the sodium channel as the first target. The new model has
been tested against experimental data on action potential clamp, and on force-
interval and duration-interval relations; it has been found to reliably
reproduce experimental observations.
